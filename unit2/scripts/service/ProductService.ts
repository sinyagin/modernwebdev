// This file should contain ProductService implementation which is responsible for managing products.
// All other parts of the app shouldn't access data/*.json files directly, instead they should use this service.

// Leverage as many TypeScript features (classes, type annotations, lambdas, etc.)
// as you can (and as it seems reasonable to you ;))
